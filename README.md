# Groffwork
Collection of groff related files and formats. Includs the .ms files for other projects. 

The **groff_macros** file holds my own macros and will be updated as I use groff more.
## Source Files
Source files for other projects can be found under **source_ms_documents**. Current projects here are:

Bash scripts to automate groff compilation can be found in the **bash_scripts** file. See the README there for further information and references.
